# Installation and usage
`npm install`

`npm start`

To get a better feel of what your web app should do, visit the final version [here](http://spiritual-dolls.surge.sh)

### Solution

An example solution is provided [here](/solutions/2_todo-list)

# Question 2
Add a button to reverse the list

### Hint
Here is how you reverse an array without mutation. You'll have to do this in the reducer.

`let newArray = originalArray.slice().reverse()`

### Hint 2
Your reducer will need to be able to process another action
You will also be dispatching another action
