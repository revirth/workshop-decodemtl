This react app currently does not do anything. Integrate react redux. Use the reference sheet if you need help [reference sheet](/reference/README.md). You can also go back to the solution video of the first exercise.

To get a better feel of what your web app should do, visit the final version [here](http://likeable-stop.surge.sh)

### Solution

An example solution is provided [here](/solutions/3_theme-creator)

# Question 2
Add a checkbox to toggle the boldness of the text.

# Question 3
Add a button to change the text on the left hand side to a randomly generated string.

### Hint

- [Generating random strings (copy pasting allowed)](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=generate+random+string+javascript)
- The string on the left hand side will go into the state
- You will need to add something to the parameter of the connect in [Preview.js](./Preview.js).
